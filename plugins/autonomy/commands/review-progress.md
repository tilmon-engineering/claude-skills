# Review Progress

You must invoke the `reviewing-progress` skill to assess progress toward the current goal.

Use the Skill tool:
```
skill: "autonomy:reviewing-progress"
```

The skill will:
1. Load and summarize all iterations for the goal
2. Present progress metrics and completed work
3. Identify current blockers and open questions
4. Suggest next steps for continuing the goal
