## Key Findings

### Finding 1: [Concise finding statement]

**Magnitude:** [Quantify the difference]

**Explanation:** [Why this difference exists]

**Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]

Example:
### Finding 1: Northeast generates 17% more revenue than Southeast

**Magnitude:** $66,780 higher revenue in Q1 ($458,920 vs $392,140)

**Explanation:** Revenue advantage stems from two factors:
1. Larger customer base (+232 customers, +8.9%)
2. Higher revenue per customer (+$11.22, +7.5%)

Product mix contributes modestly - Northeast's 3pp preference for Electronics adds ~$8K to the gap.

**Confidence:** High - robust sample sizes, consistent across metrics, confounds controlled

## Directional Summary

[High-level takeaway from the comparison]

Example:
"Northeast outperforms Southeast on nearly all metrics, with advantages concentrated in customer acquisition (9% more customers) and per-customer value (8% higher). The regions show similar customer engagement patterns (transactions per customer within 5%), suggesting behavioral similarity despite outcome differences. This points to market or operational factors rather than customer behavior as drivers of regional performance gap."

## Confidence Assessment

### High Confidence Conclusions

[What you can state with strong evidence]

1. [Conclusion with reasoning]
2. [Conclusion with reasoning]

Example:
1. **Northeast revenue advantage is real and substantial (17%):** Based on 90 days of data, >9,000 transactions, robust across multiple metrics
2. **Advantage is dual-source (volume + value):** Mathematical decomposition clearly shows both factors contribute ~equally

### Medium Confidence Conclusions

[What is likely but has some uncertainty]

1. [Conclusion with caveat]
2. [Conclusion with caveat]

Example:
1. **Product mix contributes modestly:** Electronics preference explains ~$8K of $67K gap, but product-level data has some attribution uncertainty
2. **Regions have similar customer engagement:** Similar transaction frequency, but limited to 3-month window

### Low Confidence / Uncertain

[What remains unclear or speculative]

1. [Uncertainty with explanation]
2. [Uncertainty with explanation]

Example:
1. **Root cause of customer count difference:** Could be market size, acquisition effectiveness, or historical factors - cannot determine from available data
2. **Sustainability of patterns:** Only 3 months of data - unclear if patterns hold year-round

## Limitations and Caveats

### Data Limitations

[What data constraints limit conclusions?]

1. **[Limitation]:** [Impact on analysis]
2. **[Limitation]:** [Impact on analysis]

Example:
1. **No operational data:** Cannot determine if differences stem from store count, hours, or staffing
2. **Limited time window:** 3 months may not capture full seasonal patterns or year-round dynamics
3. **No customer demographics:** Cannot control for population characteristics that might differ by region

### Analytical Limitations

[What methodological constraints exist?]

1. **[Limitation]:** [Impact]
2. **[Limitation]:** [Impact]

Example:
1. **Observational data only:** Cannot make causal claims about WHY regions differ
2. **No statistical testing:** Differences described but not tested for statistical significance
3. **Potential unmeasured confounds:** Store characteristics, competitive landscape, marketing spend not available

### Scope Limitations

[What was excluded from comparison?]

Example:
1. **Costs not included:** Compared revenue only, not profitability
2. **Other regions excluded:** Binary comparison (NE vs SE) - West and Midwest not analyzed
3. **Customer lifetime value:** Single quarter snapshot, not long-term value

## Actionable Insights

[What can be done with these findings?]

### Insight 1: [Actionable statement]

**The Opportunity:** [What this insight suggests is possible]

**Why It Matters:** [Business impact or value]

**Supporting Evidence:** [Reference to findings]

Example:
### Insight 1: Southeast has potential to close 17% revenue gap with Northeast

**The Opportunity:** If Southeast could achieve Northeast's performance levels, it would generate additional $66K per quarter ($265K annually)

**Why It Matters:** Material revenue growth opportunity (~17% increase) from existing operations

**Supporting Evidence:** Northeast demonstrates that $161/customer revenue is achievable; Southeast currently at $150/customer

### Insight 2: [Next insight]

[Repeat structure]

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: [High-priority recommendation]

**Recommendation:** [Specific action to take]

**Rationale:** [Why this matters, based on comparison findings]

**Expected Impact:** [What change would this drive]

**Implementation:** [How to do this]

**Data/Analysis Needed:** [What additional investigation would help]

Example:
### Priority 1: Investigate root cause of customer count difference

**Recommendation:** Conduct deep-dive analysis to understand why Northeast has 9% more customers than Southeast

**Rationale:** Customer acquisition accounts for ~50% of revenue gap. Understanding whether this stems from market size, operational factors, or acquisition effectiveness is critical to determining if Southeast can close the gap.

**Expected Impact:** If gap is operational/tactical (not market size), could guide strategies to boost Southeast customer base by up to 232 customers (~$36K quarterly revenue)

**Implementation:**
1. Gather data on: store count, market population, marketing spend, competitive intensity per region
2. Use guided-investigation skill to answer: "Why does Northeast have more customers?"
3. If operational factors identified, pilot interventions in Southeast to test effectiveness

**Data/Analysis Needed:**
- Store locations and square footage by region
- Regional population and demographics
- Marketing spend by region
- Customer acquisition cost and channel mix

### Priority 2: [Next recommendation]

[Repeat structure]

### Priority 3: [Next recommendation]

## Follow-Up Questions

[What questions does this comparison raise for future investigation?]

1. **[Question]:** [Why this matters]
   - **Suggested process:** [hypothesis-testing / guided-investigation / comparative-analysis / exploratory-analysis]
   - **Data required:** [What you'd need]

Example:
1. **Why does Northeast have more customers?**
   - **Suggested process:** `guided-investigation` - decompose into market, operational, and acquisition factors
   - **Data required:** Store count, market demographics, marketing spend, acquisition channels

2. **Can Southeast replicate Northeast's product mix?**
   - **Suggested process:** `hypothesis-testing` - test if shifting SE toward Electronics would improve revenue/customer
   - **Data required:** Product availability by region, Electronics demand elasticity

3. **Do patterns hold year-round?**
   - **Suggested process:** `comparative-analysis` - repeat comparison for Q2, Q3, Q4 to check consistency
   - **Data required:** Full year of transaction data

## Comparison Validity

[Final assessment of how fair and valid the comparison was]

**Fair Comparison Checklist:**
- [x] Groups clearly defined and non-overlapping
- [x] Time periods aligned (both Q1 2024)
- [x] Sample sizes adequate (>2,500 customers per group)
- [x] Data quality comparable (>99% complete both groups)
- [x] Known confounds controlled (time, seasonality, data quality)
- [ ] All potential confounds addressed (operational factors unknown)

**Overall Validity:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Reasoning:** [Explain validity assessment]

Example:
**Overall Validity:** Medium-High

**Reasoning:** Comparison is well-controlled for temporal and data quality factors. Sample sizes are robust. Primary limitation is inability to control for operational differences (store count, hours, staffing) which may explain some or all of observed differences. Comparison validly describes WHAT differs but has limited ability to determine WHY.
