# Comparison Definition

## Comparison Objective

[Clear statement of what you're comparing and why]

Example: "Compare sales performance between Northeast and Southeast regions to understand regional differences and identify growth opportunities."

## Comparison Type

**Type:** [Select one: Segment Comparison / Cohort Comparison / Time Period Comparison / Before-After Comparison]

**Explanation:** [Brief description of comparison type]

Examples:
- **Segment Comparison:** Comparing naturally-occurring groups (regions, product categories, customer tiers)
- **Cohort Comparison:** Comparing groups defined by shared timing (signup month, first purchase year)
- **Time Period Comparison:** Comparing same metrics across different time ranges (Q1 vs Q2, 2024 vs 2025)
- **Before-After Comparison:** Comparing metrics before and after an event/intervention (pre-launch vs post-launch)

## Groups Being Compared

### Group 1: [Name/Description]
**Definition:** [How this group is defined in the data]
**Size/Scope:** [Expected magnitude - approximate # of records, customers, transactions]
**Time Period:** [What time range for this group]

Example:
### Group 1: Northeast Region
**Definition:** Customers where `region = 'Northeast'`
**Size/Scope:** ~15,000 transactions from approximately 2,500 customers
**Time Period:** January 2024 - March 2024 (Q1)

### Group 2: [Name/Description]
**Definition:** [How this group is defined]
**Size/Scope:** [Expected magnitude]
**Time Period:** [What time range]

### Group 3: [If comparing more than 2 groups]
...

## Comparison Metrics

[What specific metrics will be compared across groups?]

**Primary Metrics:**
1. **[Metric name]:** [Definition, why it matters]
2. **[Metric name]:** [Definition, why it matters]
3. **[Metric name]:** [Definition, why it matters]

Example:
**Primary Metrics:**
1. **Total Revenue:** Total sales dollars - measures overall volume
2. **Average Transaction Size:** Revenue per transaction - measures customer purchasing behavior
3. **Customer Count:** Unique customers - measures market penetration
4. **Transactions per Customer:** Average purchases per customer - measures engagement/loyalty

**Secondary Metrics:**
[Additional metrics that provide context]

1. **[Metric name]:** [Why this is useful context]
2. **[Metric name]:** [Why this is useful context]

Example:
**Secondary Metrics:**
1. **Product Mix:** Distribution of sales across categories - helps explain revenue differences
2. **Temporal Distribution:** Day-of-week patterns - checks for operational differences

## Fair Comparison Principles

[What controls or adjustments are needed for fair comparison?]

**Potential Confounds to Address:**
1. **[Confound]:** [How to control for this]
2. **[Confound]:** [How to control for this]

Example:
**Potential Confounds to Address:**
1. **Time period differences:** Ensure both regions use same date range
2. **Sample size:** Normalize metrics (per customer, per day) rather than raw totals
3. **Seasonality:** If comparing different time periods, control for seasonal effects
4. **Operational differences:** Check store hours, staffing levels if available

**What constitutes "different enough to matter":**
- [Define materiality threshold]

Example: "Difference of >10% in primary metrics or >20% in secondary metrics will be considered meaningful"

## Success Criteria

[What would make this comparison complete and useful?]

Example:
- Identify which metrics differ significantly (>10%) between regions
- Quantify the magnitude of key differences
- Explain the top 2-3 drivers of differences
- Provide actionable recommendations based on findings

## Questions to Answer

[Specific questions this comparison should answer]

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

Example:
1. Which region has higher revenue, and by how much?
2. Is revenue difference due to more customers, higher transaction size, or both?
3. Do regions differ in product preferences or purchasing patterns?
4. What explains the observed differences?
