# Question Decomposition

## Broad Investigative Question

[User's original question in plain language]

Example: "Why are our sales declining in the Northeast region?"

## Context and Motivation

[Why this question matters, what decision it informs]

Example: "Sales in Northeast have dropped 15% YoY. Need to understand root cause to determine if this is a market trend, competitive pressure, operational issue, or product problem."

## Sub-Questions

Break the broad question into specific, answerable components:

### Sub-Question 1: [Specific question]
**What we need to learn:** [Clear statement of what this answers]
**Why it matters:** [How this relates to the broad question]
**Success criteria:** [What would constitute an answer]

Example:
### Sub-Question 1: Is the decline uniform across all months or concentrated in specific periods?
**What we need to learn:** Temporal pattern of the decline
**Why it matters:** Helps distinguish seasonal effects from sustained trends
**Success criteria:** Monthly sales comparison showing when decline started and if it's accelerating

### Sub-Question 2: [Another specific question]
...

### Sub-Question 3: [Another specific question]
...

## Investigation Dependencies

[Which sub-questions need to be answered first? What's the logical order?]

Example:
1. Start with temporal patterns (SQ1) - establishes baseline understanding
2. Then segment analysis (SQ2, SQ3) - identifies which segments are affected
3. Finally product analysis (SQ4) - determines if specific products drive the pattern
4. Context analysis (SQ5) - checks for external factors

## Hypotheses to Consider

[What are possible explanations we should investigate?]

Note: Unlike hypothesis-testing skill, these are informal "things to check" not formal H0/H1

Example:
1. Competitive pressure: New competitor entered market in Q2
2. Product quality: Customer complaints increased starting March
3. Pricing: Prices increased 8% in January
4. Seasonality: Historical Q1 weakness
5. Sales team: Turnover in sales team in February

## Success Criteria for Overall Investigation

[What would make this investigation complete?]

Example: "Investigation complete when we can identify the top 2-3 factors driving the decline and quantify their relative impact."
