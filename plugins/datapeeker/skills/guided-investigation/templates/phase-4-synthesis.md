# Synthesis

## Investigation Summary

[One paragraph: What was the broad question and what did you investigate?]

Example: "Investigated why Northeast region sales declined 15% YoY by examining temporal patterns, regional segmentation, product mix, and customer behavior across 5 sub-questions."

## Sub-Question Findings Recap

### SQ1: [Question]
**Finding:** [One-sentence answer]

### SQ2: [Question]
**Finding:** [One-sentence answer]

### SQ3: [Question]
**Finding:** [One-sentence answer]

[etc.]

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

[What patterns emerged across multiple sub-questions?]

Example:
1. **Timing alignment:** Decline started in January 2024 across all regions and product categories
2. **Volume vs price:** All segments show volume decline with stable pricing
3. **Customer concentration:** 70% of decline comes from mid-tier customer segment

## Hypothesis Assessment

[From Phase 1, which hypotheses are supported by evidence?]

### Hypothesis: Competitive pressure
**Evidence:**
- Transaction volume dropped 15% starting January
- Average ticket size unchanged (no price competition)
- Decline concentrated in mid-tier customers

**Assessment:** **SUPPORTED** - pattern is consistent with new competitor targeting mid-market

### Hypothesis: Product quality issues
**Evidence:**
- No change in return rates
- Product mix stable
- No correlation between decline and specific product categories

**Assessment:** **NOT SUPPORTED** - if quality were the issue, we'd see product-specific effects

### Hypothesis: [Another hypothesis]
**Evidence:** [...]
**Assessment:** [SUPPORTED / PARTIALLY SUPPORTED / NOT SUPPORTED]

## Integrated Explanation

[Synthesize findings into a coherent story]

Example: "The 15% sales decline in Northeast is best explained by competitive pressure beginning in January 2024. The pattern shows:

1. Sudden onset (January start date) suggests market event, not gradual trend
2. Volume decline with stable pricing suggests customers switching to alternative, not reducing consumption
3. Mid-tier customer concentration matches known competitor's target market
4. Geographic concentration in Northeast aligns with competitor's initial market entry

While we cannot definitively prove causation without competitor data, the circumstantial evidence strongly points to competitive pressure as the primary driver."

## Confidence Assessment

[How confident are you in this explanation?]

**Confidence Level:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Reasoning:**
- Strengths: [What makes you confident?]
- Weaknesses: [What creates uncertainty?]
- Data gaps: [What data would increase confidence?]

Example:
**Confidence Level:** Medium-High

**Reasoning:**
- Strengths: Multiple independent lines of evidence point to same conclusion; timing and segmentation patterns are consistent with competitive hypothesis
- Weaknesses: No direct competitor data to confirm; cannot rule out other January 2024 events (promotion ending, marketing change, etc.)
- Data gaps: Competitor market entry dates, customer churn destination data, lost deal analysis would confirm hypothesis
