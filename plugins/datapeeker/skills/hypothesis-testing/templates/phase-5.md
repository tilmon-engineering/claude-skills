# Conclusion and Follow-up

## Main Conclusion

[1-2 sentences: What did you learn? What should reader take away?]

Example: "Sales vary significantly by day of week, with Wednesday showing 42% higher average sales than Sunday. However, this pattern may be partially or fully explained by operational factors (store hours, staffing) rather than customer behavior differences."

## Actionable Insights

[What decisions or actions does this support? Be specific.]

1. [Specific recommendation based on findings]
2. [Alternative action if confounds are present]

Example:
1. IF pattern is driven by customer behavior: Consider promotions on low-traffic days (Sun, Mon)
2. IF pattern is driven by store hours: Test extended hours on Sunday to see if sales increase proportionally

## Follow-up Questions

[What should be investigated next? Prioritize by importance.]

1. **[Question 1]:** [Why this matters, what it would clarify]
   - Data needed: [What data would answer this?]
   - Approach: [How would you test this?]

2. **[Question 2]:** [...]

Example:
1. **Are store hours consistent across days?** This would help separate operational from behavioral effects
   - Data needed: Store hours by day, or transaction time stamps
   - Approach: Analyze sales by hour-of-day, grouped by day-of-week

2. **Do promotions correlate with high-sales days?** This would test the promotion confound
   - Data needed: Promotion calendar with dates and products
   - Approach: Join promotion data with sales, compare promoted vs non-promoted days

3. **Is the pattern consistent across all stores/regions?** Tests generalizability
   - Data needed: Store or region identifiers
   - Approach: Repeat day-of-week analysis segmented by store

## Confidence Level

[How confident are you in the main conclusion?]

- High confidence: Strong evidence, few confounds, adequate sample sizes
- Medium confidence: Clear pattern but significant confounds not ruled out
- Low confidence: Weak evidence, major limitations, small samples
