# Hypothesis Formulation

## Analytical Goal
[User's question in plain language]

## Context
[Why this matters, business/research context]

## Hypotheses

### Null Hypothesis (H0)
[Precise statement of "no effect" or baseline assumption]

Example: "Day of week has no effect on sales volume - all days have equal expected sales"

### Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
[What you're looking for evidence of]

Example: "Day of week affects sales volume - some days have significantly higher/lower sales than others"

## Success Criteria
[What would make you reject H0? What magnitude of difference matters practically?]

## Potential Confounds
[What other factors might explain differences? List now, before seeing data]
- Factor 1: [e.g., seasonality, holidays]
- Factor 2: [e.g., promotions, store closures]
- Factor 3: [e.g., weather, local events]
