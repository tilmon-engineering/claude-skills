# Insights

## Insight Criteria

For this exploration, an insight must be:
- **Actionable:** Informs a decision or next investigation
- **Surprising:** Non-obvious or counter-intuitive
- **Meaningful:** Magnitude is significant enough to matter

---

## Insight 1: [Concise insight statement]

### The Finding

[Describe the pattern or relationship in specific terms]

Example: "Weekend sales are 40% lower than weekday sales, driven entirely by transaction volume (not ticket size)"

### Why It's Significant

[Explain why this matters - business impact, decision relevance, strategic importance]

Example: "If pattern is due to operational constraints (reduced hours), there's significant untapped revenue potential. If due to customer behavior, staffing/inventory strategies should shift toward weekdays."

### Supporting Evidence

[Reference specific analyses from Phases 2-3]

- Found in: [file reference]
- Key data points:
  - [Specific metric 1]
  - [Specific metric 2]
- Magnitude: [Quantify the effect]
- Consistency: [Is pattern consistent across time/segments?]

### Context and Interpretation

[Provide business context, possible explanations]

Example: "Could be explained by:
1. Store hours (reduced weekend hours)
2. Customer behavior (fewer weekend shoppers)
3. Product availability (limited weekend inventory)

Need operational data to distinguish these explanations."

### Caveats and Limitations

[What reduces confidence or limits applicability?]

Example:
- Based on 3 months of data (Jan-Mar); seasonal effects unknown
- Cannot distinguish operational constraints from demand patterns
- No control for holidays or special events

### Confidence Level

**Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Reasoning:** [Why this confidence level?]

Example:
**Confidence:** Medium

**Reasoning:** Pattern is clear and consistent across 13 weeks (strengthens confidence), but cannot determine causation without operational data (weakens confidence). Sample size is adequate.

### Recommended Action

[What should be done with this insight?]

- [ ] Further investigation: [What to investigate]
- [ ] Business decision: [What decision this informs]
- [ ] Data collection: [What additional data would help]

Example:
- [ ] Investigate store hours by day-of-week to test operational constraint hypothesis
- [ ] Run A/B test: extend Sunday hours and measure sales per operating hour
- [ ] Collect weekend vs weekday customer surveys to understand behavioral differences

## Insight 2: [Next insight]

[Repeat structure]

## Insight 3: [Next insight]

[Repeat structure]

## Non-Insights (Patterns That Didn't Qualify)

[List patterns found that were interesting but didn't meet insight criteria]

### Pattern: [Description]
**Why not an insight:** [Too small magnitude / Not actionable / Expected/obvious]

Example:
### Pattern: Sales increased 2% from January to March
**Why not an insight:** Magnitude too small to be meaningful (within normal variance); also could be seasonal effect of moving from winter to spring

2. **[Insight]:** [One sentence summary]
3. **[Insight]:** [One sentence summary]

### Cross-Cutting Themes

[Are there themes that connect multiple insights?]

Example: "Multiple insights point to a customer segmentation issue - mid-tier customers behaving very differently from high/low tiers across time, product, and geography dimensions."

### Strategic Implications

[What do these insights collectively suggest about strategy, operations, or priorities?]

Example: "Dataset reveals significant untapped potential in weekend/Sunday operations and mid-tier customer retention. Both represent high-impact opportunities for revenue growth."
