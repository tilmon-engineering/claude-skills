# Theme Development & Refinement

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 5 - Theme Development & Refinement

---

## Theme 1: [Theme Name]

### Theme Definition

**Theme:** [Descriptive name, 4-8 words]

**Definition:** [What does this theme capture? The overarching pattern or concept connecting multiple codes]

**Prevalence:** [X of Y participants, Z total coded segments]

### Supporting Codes

**Codes that contribute to this theme:**
- [code-1] ([N] occurrences)
- [code-2] ([N] occurrences)
- [code-3] ([N] occurrences)

### Representative Quotes (from extract-supporting-quotes agent)

**Quote 1:**
> "[Verbatim data extract]"

**Source:** Participant [N], [Context if relevant]

---

**Quote 2:**
> "[Verbatim data extract]"

**Source:** Participant [N]

---

**Quote 3:**
> "[Verbatim data extract]"

**Source:** Participant [N]

---

### Disconfirming Evidence Search (MANDATORY)

**Agent:** search-disconfirming-evidence

**Input:** Theme definition + full dataset

**Date run:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Contradictions Found:**

#### Contradiction 1: [Description]

**Data Extract:**
> "[Quote that contradicts theme]"

**Source:** Participant [N]

**Why This Contradicts:** [Explanation]

**Prevalence of contradiction:** [N participants show this pattern]

---

#### Contradiction 2: [Description]

[Same structure...]

---

**Negative Cases (Participants Who Don't Fit Theme):**

**Participant [N]:**
- What they said instead: "[Quote]"
- Why theme doesn't apply: [Explanation]
- Alternative pattern they exhibit: [Description]

**Participant [N]:**
[Same structure...]

---

**Theme Refinement Based on Disconfirming Evidence:**

**Original prevalence:** [X of Y participants]
**Revised prevalence:** [A of B participants] (excluding [C] who don't fit)

**Original definition:** [What it was before disconfirmation search]
**Refined definition:** [Revised to account for contradictions and boundaries]

**Boundary clarification:**
- **Include:** [What clearly belongs in this theme]
- **Exclude:** [What clearly doesn't belong]

### Negative Case Explanation

**Participants who don't fit this theme ([N] of [Y]):**

**Why they don't fit:**
[Explanation of why certain participants don't exhibit this pattern]

**Their pattern instead:**
[What pattern DO these participants show?]

**Interpretation:**
[What do negative cases tell us about boundaries or conditions for this theme?]

---

## Theme 2: [Theme Name]

[Same complete structure as Theme 1...]

---

## Theme 3: [Theme Name]

[Same complete structure as Theme 1...]

---

## Cross-Theme Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify relationships between themes.

### Theme Overlap

**Themes 1 & 2:**
- Participants who show BOTH themes: [List participants]
- Relationship: [How do these themes relate? Complementary? Sequential? Conditional?]

**Themes 2 & 3:**
[Same structure...]

### Theme Independence

**Themes that don't overlap:**
[Which themes appear in distinct participant groups? What does this tell us?]

### Dominant Patterns

**Most prevalent theme:** [Theme name] ([X] of [Y] participants)
**Least prevalent theme:** [Theme name] ([A] of [Y] participants)

**Interpretation:**
[What does prevalence distribution tell us about the data/research question?]

---

## Themes NOT Supported

**Purpose:** Document themes that were considered but didn't hold up after disconfirming evidence search.

### Rejected Theme: [Name]

**Why considered:** [Initial pattern that suggested this theme]

**Why rejected:** [Contradictions found, insufficient support, alternative explanation]

**What we learned:** [What did this tell us about the data?]

---

## Phase 5 Checkpoint Verification

**Before proceeding to Phase 6, verify:**

- [ ] All themes defined with clear descriptions
- [ ] Supporting codes identified for each theme
- [ ] Prevalence calculated for each theme (X of Y participants)
- [ ] Representative quotes extracted for each theme
- [ ] **Disconfirming evidence search COMPLETED for ALL themes** (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Contradictions documented and analyzed
- [ ] Negative cases identified and explained
- [ ] Theme definitions refined based on disconfirming evidence
- [ ] Honest prevalence reporting (revised counts if needed)
- [ ] All results saved to `05-theme-development.md`

**Checkpoint status:** [PASS / FAIL]

**If PASS:** Proceed to Phase 6 - Synthesis & Reporting
**If FAIL:** Complete missing requirements (especially disconfirming evidence search)
