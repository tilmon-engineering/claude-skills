## Interview Protocol

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Greeting:**
- Thank participant for their time
- Introduce yourself briefly
- Offer water/comfort items if in-person

**Purpose Statement:**
"I'm researching [general topic] to understand [broad goal]. Your insights will help us [purpose]. I'm interested in your honest experience - there are no right or wrong answers."

**Consent & Recording:**
"This conversation will take about [X] minutes. I'd like to [record / take notes] so I can focus on our conversation rather than writing everything down. Everything you share will be [confidentiality statement - anonymous, aggregated, etc.]. The recording will be [stored securely / transcribed and deleted / etc.]."

**Obtain explicit consent:**
- [ ] Verbal consent recorded at start of audio
- OR [ ] Written consent form signed

**If consent refused:** Respect decision. Offer written notes only. If they decline participation, thank them and end interview.

**Warm-up:**
"To start, can you tell me a bit about [relevant context]?"
- Use this to build rapport
- Listen for context that will inform later questions
- Do NOT start with hard questions

---

### Core Interview (30-45 minutes)

**Critical interviewing principles:**

#### 1. Follow the Guide, BUT Stay Flexible

- Use your interview guide as a map, not a script
- If participant raises something interesting, follow that thread
- Return to guide questions when natural
- It's OK to reorder questions based on flow

#### 2. Use Probes Effectively

**When to probe:**
- Answer is vague or general
- Participant says "usually" or "sometimes" (ask for specific example)
- Interesting point mentioned briefly
- Answer seems incomplete

**Probing techniques:**

**Echo probe:** Repeat their last few words with questioning tone
- Participant: "It was frustrating..."
- You: "Frustrating...?"

**Silent probe:** Pause and maintain eye contact (3-5 seconds)
- Most people will fill the silence with more detail

**Specific example probe:**
- "Can you give me a specific example of that?"
- "Tell me about the last time that happened"
- "Walk me through what that looked like"

**Clarification probe:**
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Can you say more about that?"
- "Help me understand [aspect] better"

**Contrast probe:**
- "How is that different from [other situation]?"
- "What would have made that situation better/worse?"

#### 3. Avoid Leading Questions

**BAD (leading):**
- "So that must have been frustrating, right?"
- "Don't you think that [X] would solve this?"
- "Most people say [Y], do you agree?"

**GOOD (neutral):**
- "How did that feel?"
- "What would have made that better?"
- "What's your experience with [X]?"

#### 4. Listen More Than You Talk

**Good ratio:** 80% participant talking, 20% you asking/probing

**Red flags you're talking too much:**
- Explaining your own experiences
- Offering opinions or advice
- Finishing their sentences
- Immediately jumping to next question

#### 5. Handle Tangents

**Participant goes off-topic:**
- Let them finish their thought (don't interrupt)
- Acknowledge what they said: "That makes sense..."
- Redirect: "Going back to what you said about [X]..."

**Participant asks you questions:**
- "That's a great question - I'd love to hear your thoughts on it first"
- Defer your opinion until end if necessary
- Remember: You're here to learn from THEM, not share your views

---

### Managing Challenging Situations

#### Participant Gives Very Short Answers

**Strategies:**
1. Use silent probes (pause, wait)
2. Ask for specific examples: "Can you tell me about a time when..."
3. Lower the stakes: "There's no right answer - I'm just curious about your experience"
4. Check-in: "Am I asking questions in a way that makes sense?"

#### Participant Rambles or Goes Off-Topic

**Strategies:**
1. Let them finish (interrupting damages rapport)
2. Find the relevant thread: "You mentioned [relevant bit], can we explore that more?"
3. Redirect politely: "That's interesting. I want to make sure we cover [topic] - can we talk about that?"

#### Participant Seems Uncomfortable or Emotional

**Strategies:**
1. Pause the interview: "Would you like to take a break?"
2. Remind them they can skip questions: "We can skip this question if you prefer"
3. Offer to stop: "We can stop here if you'd like"
4. Show empathy, but don't pry into emotional topics beyond your research scope

#### Participant Asks "What Are You Looking For?"

**Response:**
"I'm not looking for any particular answer - I want to understand your genuine experience. Whatever you share is valuable."

**Do NOT:**
- Tell them what you're hoping to find (creates bias)
- Suggest they're answering "wrong"
- Share your hypothesis

---

### Closing (5-10 minutes)

**Wrap-up question (ALWAYS ask):**
"Is there anything about [topic] that I haven't asked about that you think is important?"
- This often yields the most valuable insights
- Participants share what THEY think matters, not what you asked about

**Referrals:**
"Do you know anyone else who [deals with this problem / has this experience] who might be willing to share their perspective?"
- Record referrals for snowball sampling

**Thank you:**
"Thank you so much for your time and insights. This has been really helpful."

**Incentive (if applicable):**
- Provide gift card / compensation as promised
- Get receipt if required

**Post-Interview:**
- [ ] Stop recording
- [ ] Save recording with filename: `interview-[participant-ID]-[date].m4a`
- [ ] Immediately write reflexivity notes (see below)

## Common Interview Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Jumping to solutions**
- Don't ask "Would you use X?"
- DO ask "How do you currently solve this?"

❌ **Asking hypothetical questions**
- Don't ask "What would you do if..."
- DO ask "Tell me about the last time you..."

❌ **Sharing your opinions**
- Don't say "I think X is important, do you?"
- DO ask "What matters most to you about X?"

❌ **Accepting vague answers**
- Don't move on when they say "usually" or "sometimes"
- DO probe: "Can you give me a specific example?"

❌ **Interrupting**
- Don't cut them off to ask next question
- DO let them finish, then probe for more

❌ **Asking double-barreled questions**
- Don't ask "How do you X and what do you think about Y?"
- DO ask one question at a time

❌ **Revealing your hypothesis**
- Don't tell them what you're hoping to find
- DO stay neutral about what you're investigating

✅ **Good interviewing looks like:**
- Mostly listening (80/20 ratio)
- Asking for specific examples constantly
- Comfortable with silence
- Following interesting threads even if not in guide
- Probing vague answers
- Staying neutral and curious
