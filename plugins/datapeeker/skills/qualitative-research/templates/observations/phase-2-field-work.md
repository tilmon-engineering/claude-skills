# Data Collection - Observational Field Work

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 2 - Data Collection (Observation Method)

---

## Pre-Field Work Checklist

**Before EACH observation session:**

- [ ] Field note template accessible (digital or paper notebook)
- [ ] Multiple pens (backups in case one runs out)
- [ ] Audio recorder tested (if using - with consent obtained)
- [ ] Camera ready (if using - with consent obtained)
- [ ] Watch or timer to track time
- [ ] Observation protocol reviewed (what to focus on)
- [ ] Contact information for gatekeeper/host
- [ ] Appropriate clothing (blend in with setting)
- [ ] Transportation/access arranged

---

## Field Work Execution Protocol

### Arrival & Positioning

**Upon arrival:**

1. **Check in with gatekeeper/host**
   - Remind them of your purpose
   - Confirm duration of observation
   - Ask about any changes or special events happening today

2. **Position yourself strategically**
   - **If non-participant:** Where can you observe without being intrusive?
     - Corner with good sight lines
     - Position where you can see but aren't in the way
   - **If participant:** Where should you be to participate while observing?
     - Alongside workers/participants
     - Engaged but maintaining observer awareness

3. **Initial orientation (first 5-10 minutes)**
   - Get a sense of the space
   - Note who's present, the environment, activities happening
   - Let people acclimate to your presence before detailed note-taking

---

### Note-Taking During Observation

**Two-phase approach:**

#### Phase 1: Jottings (during observation)

**If full notes would be disruptive:**
- Quick keywords and phrases
- Time stamps
- Key quotes verbatim (in quotes)
- Diagrams/sketches of space or positioning

**Example jottings:**
```
9:05 - Mgr enters, no greeting, sits head table
9:12 - "We need to hit deadline" (Mgr A)
9:15 - Long silence, ~20 sec, team looks at each other
```

#### Phase 2: Expanded Field Notes (immediately after - within 2 hours)

**CRITICAL:** Jottings MUST be expanded same day or you'll forget details.

**Expand jottings into:**
- Complete sentences
- Thick description (specific behaviors, not interpretations)
- Reflective notes (interpretations, questions, patterns)
- Direct quotes expanded with context

---

### What to Record

**For each significant moment:**

1. **TIME:** When did it happen?
2. **WHO:** Who was involved? Use consistent pseudonyms or roles
3. **WHAT:** What happened? Thick description - specific behaviors, not interpretations
4. **WHERE:** Location/positioning - where were people? How were they arranged?
5. **HOW:** How did it happen? Tone, manner, sequence
6. **CONTEXT:** What was happening before/after? What might have triggered this?

---

### Thick Description Guidelines

**Aim for descriptive, not interpretive:**

❌ **Interpretive (avoid):**
"The manager was angry."

✅ **Descriptive (use):**
"The manager's voice volume increased, face reddened, fist hit table once. Said 'This is unacceptable' in clipped tone."

---

❌ **Interpretive:**
"The team was disengaged."

✅ **Descriptive:**
"Three of five team members had laptops open but screens showed email/browsing, not meeting materials. Two team members checked phones 3+ times in 10 minutes. When asked questions, responses were one word with no elaboration."

---

**Include:**
- **Verbatim quotes:** Put in "quotation marks" exactly as said
- **Physical details:** Posture, positioning, gestures, facial expressions
- **Environmental details:** Noise, lighting, space configuration
- **Timing:** Duration of events, pauses, pacing
- **Sequence:** What happened first, next, then?

---

## Field Note Format

**Use two-column format for real-time pattern recognition:**

### Session [N] - [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Location:** [Where]
**Time:** [HH:MM - HH:MM]
**Duration:** [Total time]
**Weather/Environment:** [Conditions that might affect behavior]

---

| TIME | DESCRIPTIVE NOTES (What I observe) | REFLECTIVE NOTES (What I think/question) |
|------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 9:00am | **Setting:** Room 12x15, fluorescent lights, 6-person table. Whiteboard on north wall with "Q3 Goals" written. Coffee maker in corner, half-full pot.<br><br>**People present:** 5 people (3 women, 2 men). All appeared 30-50 years old, business casual dress. Seated around table. | First impression: Corporate office, typical meeting room. Coffee suggests longer meeting planned.<br><br>Question: Why only 5? Was expecting 6 based on gatekeeper comment. |
| 9:05am | **Event:** Person A (woman, ~40s, wearing blue blazer) enters room. Does not greet others. Sits at head of table (north end). Opens laptop, begins typing. Other 4 people already present exchange brief glances - eye contact with each other, then look down at their own materials.<br><br>**No verbal interaction.** Silence lasted ~30 seconds. | **Pattern?** Power dynamic evident. A seems to be manager/leader based on seating and others' reactions.<br><br>**Surprise:** Expected verbal greeting. Lack of greeting seems intentional? Or normal here?<br><br>**Check assumption:** I expected more casual/friendly culture based on company's public image. |
| 9:07am | **A speaks:** "Let's get started. We need to hit the deadline." Voice was flat affect, no pleasantries.<br><br>**Person B responds:** "We're on track for the main deliverables." Looked at laptop while speaking, minimal eye contact with A. | **Language note:** "Need to" not "want to" - obligation framing.<br><br>**Body language:** B avoiding eye contact - discomfort? Norm here? |

## Managing Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Information Overload

**Problem:** Too much happening, can't record everything

**Solutions:**
1. **Focus:** Return to your observation protocol - what MATTERS for research question?
2. **Prioritize:** Record events/interactions directly relevant to research question first
3. **Sample:** If continuous observation is overwhelming, switch to time sampling (observe for 5 min every 15 min)
4. **Accept limitations:** You can't capture everything - that's OK

**Document:** Note in reflective column what you're NOT capturing and why.

---

### Challenge 2: Observer Effect

**Problem:** People are acting differently because you're watching

**Indicators:**
- People keep looking at you
- Activities seem "performed" or staged
- People explain what they're doing unprompted
- Behavior seems unusually formal or careful

**Solutions:**
1. **Prolonged engagement:** Spend more time on-site so people acclimate
2. **Be unobtrusive:** Position yourself peripherally, avoid excessive eye contact
3. **Build rapport:** If participant observation, engage naturally
4. **Time:** Often effect diminishes after 15-20 minutes

**Document:** Note in reflexivity section when/how you think your presence affected behavior.

---

### Challenge 3: Going Native (Participant Observation)

**Problem:** You're so immersed in participation that you forget to observe

**Solutions:**
1. **Scheduled breaks:** Every 30 min, step aside to write jottings
2. **Mental flagging:** Note to self "That's interesting" in the moment, expand later
3. **Balance:** Participate enough to understand, observe enough to maintain analytical distance

**Document:** Reflect on your dual role - when did participation enhance understanding? When did it hinder observation?

---

### Challenge 4: Unexpected Events

**Problem:** Something surprising or significant happens that you weren't prepared for

**Response:**
1. **Capture as much as possible:** Even if it's not in your observation protocol
2. **Ask clarifying questions later:** "I noticed X happened - is that typical?"
3. **Return focus:** After capturing unexpected event, return to protocol
4. **Reflect:** Why was this surprising? Does it contradict assumptions?

**Document:** Unexpected events often reveal the most - give them detailed attention in field notes.

---

### Challenge 5: Emotional Response

**Problem:** You witness something upsetting, frustrating, or that triggers strong emotion

**Response:**
1. **Acknowledge:** Note your emotional response in reflective column
2. **Continue observing:** Don't let emotion stop observation (unless ethically necessary)
3. **Document bias:** How might this emotional response affect your interpretation?
4. **Debrief:** Process emotional reactions after observation session

**When to intervene:** If you witness harm, abuse, or unethical behavior, you have ethical obligation to intervene even if it interrupts research.

---

## Post-Session Protocol

**IMMEDIATELY after observation session (within 1-2 hours):**

### 1. Expand Jottings to Full Field Notes

- [ ] Expand keywords into complete sentences
- [ ] Add thick description details while memory is fresh
- [ ] Fill in gaps - what did you see but not write down in the moment?
- [ ] Expand abbreviated quotes to full verbatim
- [ ] Add environmental details

**Time commitment:** Usually 2-3x observation duration (e.g., 1 hour observation = 2-3 hours writing)

**Save as:** `field-notes-session-[N]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

---

### 2. Write Reflective Memo

**Separate from field notes - this is your analytical thinking:**

**Memo template:**

```markdown
# Reflective Memo - Session [N]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Key Observations

**Most important thing I observed:**
[What stood out as most significant?]

**Why this matters for research question:**
[Connection to your main question]

---

## Patterns Emerging

**Patterns I'm starting to see (across multiple sessions if applicable):**
1. [Pattern 1 with examples]
2. [Pattern 2 with examples]

**How confident am I in these patterns?**
[Preliminary? Strong? Need more observation to confirm?]

---

## Surprises & Contradictions

**What surprised me:**
[Anything unexpected?]

**How does this compare to my Phase 1 assumptions:**
[Confirms or contradicts?]

**Contradictions observed:**
[Did I see behaviors that contradict each other? People saying one thing but doing another?]

---

## Questions Raised

**Questions for follow-up:**
1. [Question to explore in next session]
2. [Question to ask informant]
3. [Question for further analysis]

**Concepts to investigate:**
[Terms, jargon, processes that I need to understand better]

---

## Reflexivity Check

**How did my presence affect what I observed:**
[Observer effect assessment]

**Assumptions I brought to this session:**
[What lens did I apply? How might this have biased what I noticed?]

**My emotional responses:**
[What did I feel during observation? How might this affect interpretation?]

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] [Action 1 - e.g., "Return to observe morning shift"]
- [ ] [Action 2 - e.g., "Ask about terminology X"]
- [ ] [Action 3 - e.g., "Observe different role/location"]
```

**Save as:** `memo-session-[N]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

---

### 3. Observation Log Entry

**Track each session:**

### Session 1
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Time:** [HH:MM - HH:MM]
- **Duration:** [Hours:Minutes]
- **Location:** [Where]
- **Focus:** [What you were observing]
- **Participants observed:** [N people / Roles present]
- **Environmental conditions:** [Busy/quiet, any unusual events]
- **Field notes:** `field-notes-session-01-[date].md`
- **Reflective memo:** `memo-session-01-[date].md`
- **Status:** [Complete / Partial (reason)]
- **Saturation check:** [New insights? YES / NO]
- **Observer effect:** [High / Medium / Low - your assessment]

---

### Session 2
[Same format...]

---

## Saturation Monitoring

**After each session, assess:**

- Did this session reveal NEW behaviors/patterns not seen before? [YES / NO]
- Did this session provide NEW examples of existing patterns? [YES / NO]
- Did this session contradict or complicate existing patterns? [YES / NO]

**Saturation status:**

| Session | New Patterns? | New Examples? | Contradictions? | Saturation Status |
|---------|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | N/A (first) | N/A | N/A | Building baseline |
| 2 | YES | YES | NO | Not yet |
| 3 | YES | YES | YES | Not yet |
| 4 | NO | YES | NO | Approaching |
| 5 | NO | NO | NO | Achieved |

**Saturation achieved when:** 2-3 consecutive sessions answer NO to all three questions.

**Current status:** [Not yet / Approaching / Achieved]

---

## Member Checking (Optional but Recommended)

**Purpose:** Verify your observations with participants to enhance credibility.

**Approach:**
1. **Share field notes or preliminary interpretations** with key informant(s)
2. **Ask:** "Does this accurately represent what happened? What am I missing?"
3. **Document:** Their feedback, corrections, additional context

**Member check log:**

| Date | Informant | Material Shared | Feedback Received | Changes Made |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| [Date] | [Pseudonym/role] | Session 3 field notes | [Summary of feedback] | [What you revised] |

**Note:** Member checking can reveal your blind spots OR may introduce bias if participants try to present themselves favorably. Use judiciously.

---

## Informal Conversations & Opportunistic Interviews

**During field work, spontaneous conversations often provide valuable context:**

**When someone explains something unprompted or you ask a quick clarifying question:**

**Document immediately:**

### Informal Conversation - [Date, Time]

**Person:** [Pseudonym/role]
**Context:** [Where, what prompted conversation]

**What they said (verbatim when possible):**
> "[Quote]"

**My question/prompt:**
"[What you asked]"

**Their response:**
> "[Quote]"

**Why this matters:**
[Connection to research question or observation patterns]

**Save in:** Same field notes file or separate `informal-conversations.md`

---

## Managing Relationships in the Field

### Building Rapport

**Strategies:**
- **Show genuine interest:** Ask questions, listen actively
- **Respect boundaries:** Don't pry, let people share what they're comfortable with
- **Be reliable:** Show up when promised, follow through on commitments
- **Express gratitude:** Thank people for allowing observation
- **Share when appropriate:** If asked about yourself, answer briefly but don't dominate

### Maintaining Analytical Distance

**While building rapport, maintain observer role:**
- **Don't become advocate:** You're here to understand, not to fix or judge
- **Avoid taking sides:** In conflicts, remain neutral
- **Don't "go native":** Maintain critical analytical perspective
- **Document personal connections:** How might relationships affect what you see?

---

## Ethical Considerations During Field Work

### Ongoing Consent

**Check in periodically:**
- "Are you still comfortable with me observing?"
- "Is there anything you'd prefer I not record?"

**Respect opt-outs:**
- If someone asks you to stop observing or not record something, honor that immediately
- Document what you can't observe (helps identify limitations later)

### Confidentiality in the Field

**Protect participant identity:**
- Use pseudonyms in all notes (even jottings that others might see)
- Don't share observations with other participants
- Store notes securely

### When to Intervene

**Stop observing and intervene if:**
- You witness harm, abuse, or safety violations
- Someone is in distress and needs help
- You observe illegal activity

**Document intervention:** How did it affect your observation? Your relationship with participants?

---

## Phase 2 Checkpoint Verification

**Before proceeding to Phase 3, verify:**

- [ ] All planned observation sessions completed (or saturation achieved)
- [ ] All jottings expanded to full field notes within 24 hours of observation
- [ ] All field notes use thick description (specific behaviors, not interpretations)
- [ ] Reflective memos written for each session
- [ ] Observation log complete
- [ ] Saturation monitoring documented
- [ ] Member checking conducted (if planned)
- [ ] Informal conversations documented
- [ ] Reflexivity maintained throughout (observer effect, assumptions, biases noted)
- [ ] All files saved to `02-data-collection-log.md`
- [ ] All field notes saved to `raw-data/field-notes-session-[N]-[date].md`
- [ ] All memos saved to `raw-data/memo-session-[N]-[date].md`

**Checkpoint status:** [PASS / FAIL]

**If PASS:** Proceed to Phase 3 - Data Familiarization
**If FAIL:** Complete missing requirements above before proceeding

## Common Observation Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Recording interpretations instead of behaviors**
- Don't write: "She was angry"
- DO write: "Voice volume increased, face flushed, fist hit table"

❌ **Accepting your first impressions as truth**
- First impressions are often wrong - keep observing

❌ **Only seeing what confirms your assumptions**
- Actively look for disconfirming evidence

❌ **Waiting too long to expand jottings**
- Same-day expansion is critical - you'll forget details

❌ **Observing without focus**
- Return to research question - what MATTERS?

❌ **Forgetting to observe the mundane**
- Routine, ordinary behavior reveals culture and norms

❌ **Assuming you understand insider meaning**
- Ask clarifying questions, don't assume jargon/processes are what you think

❌ **Letting personal reactions stop observation**
- Note your reactions in reflective column, but keep observing

✅ **Good observation looks like:**
- Thick description with specific details
- Both descriptive and reflective notes
- Acknowledgment of observer effect and bias
- Patterns identified tentatively, refined over multiple sessions
- Questions raised more than answers claimed
- Same-day expansion of all jottings
