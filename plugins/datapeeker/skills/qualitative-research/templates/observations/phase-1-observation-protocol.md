# Research Design - Observation Method

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 1 - Research Design
**Method:** Observational Research

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
[What are you trying to understand through observation?]

**Sub-Questions:**
1. [Supporting question 1]
2. [Supporting question 2]
3. [Supporting question 3]

**Success Criteria:**
[What would constitute a successful answer to this research question?]

---

## Reflexivity Baseline (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Document your assumptions BEFORE data collection to prevent confirmation bias.

### My Assumptions

**What I believe I'll observe:**
[Write down what you expect to see. Be specific.]

**Why I believe this:**
[What experience, expert opinion, or prior knowledge shapes this belief?]

**What would surprise me:**
[What observations would contradict your expectations?]

### My Biases

**Industry/domain experience:**
[How might your background influence what you notice or interpret?]

**Expert opinions I'm carrying:**
[What have mentors, consultants, or authorities told you?]

**Prior hypotheses:**
[What have you already concluded that might bias what you see?]

**Desired outcome:**
[What would you WANT to observe? How might this create bias?]

---

## Observation Strategy

**Why observation instead of asking?**
[Observation reveals actual behavior vs reported behavior, captures context, uncovers tacit knowledge]

**Observation type:**
- [ ] **Participant observation:** Researcher participates in activities while observing
- [ ] **Non-participant observation:** Researcher observes without participating
- [ ] **Structured observation:** Using predefined categories/checklist
- [ ] **Unstructured observation:** Open-ended, exploratory observation

**Rationale:** [Why this approach for your research question?]

**Observer role disclosure:**
- [ ] **Overt:** Participants know they're being observed
- [ ] **Covert:** Participants don't know (requires ethical justification)

**Selection:** [Which and why?]

---

## What to Observe

### Observation Focus Areas

**CRITICAL:** Don't just observe everything - you need focus while staying open to unexpected.

#### 1. Physical Setting
- **Space layout:** [How is space organized? What does layout enable/constrain?]
- **Objects/artifacts:** [What tools, technology, materials are present?]
- **Environment:** [Lighting, noise, temperature, aesthetics - how might these affect behavior?]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 2. Actors/People
- **Who is present:** [Roles, demographics, number of people]
- **Who is absent:** [Who would you expect to see but don't?]
- **Relationships:** [Hierarchies, power dynamics, formal/informal relationships]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 3. Activities/Actions
- **Tasks being performed:** [What are people doing? Step-by-step processes]
- **Sequence:** [In what order? What triggers transitions?]
- **Tools/methods used:** [How are they doing it? What do they use?]
- **Duration:** [How long do activities take?]
- **Frequency:** [How often do activities occur?]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 4. Interactions
- **Who talks to whom:** [Communication patterns, formal/informal]
- **Communication modes:** [Verbal, written, gestural, digital]
- **Tone/affect:** [Formal, casual, tense, friendly]
- **Turn-taking:** [Who initiates? Who responds? Who's silent?]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 5. Events
- **Routines:** [Predictable, recurring events]
- **Exceptional events:** [Unusual, one-off occurrences]
- **Triggers:** [What causes events to start/stop?]
- **Responses:** [How do people respond to events?]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 6. Time
- **Temporal patterns:** [Morning vs afternoon, Monday vs Friday, seasonal]
- **Pacing:** [Rush periods, slow periods, breaks]
- **Duration:** [How long things take]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 7. Goals/Purposes
- **Stated purposes:** [What people say they're trying to accomplish]
- **Observed purposes:** [What appears to be actual goal from behavior]
- **Conflicts:** [Competing goals, misaligned purposes]

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

---

#### 8. Feelings/Affect
- **Expressed emotions:** [What emotions are visible? Body language, tone, expressions]
- **Intensity:** [Subtle or obvious?]
- **Shifts:** [When do emotions change? What triggers this?]

**Note:** Be cautious interpreting emotions - verify when possible.

**Why this matters for research question:** [Connection to your question]

## Observation Protocol

### Field Note Structure

**Two-column approach (recommended):**

| Descriptive Notes | Reflective Notes |
|------------------|------------------|
| **WHAT I OBSERVE** | **WHAT I THINK/FEEL** |
| Concrete, factual, detailed | Interpretations, questions, reactions |
| Who, what, when, where, how | Emerging patterns, confusions, biases |

**Example:**

| Descriptive Notes | Reflective Notes |
|------------------|------------------|
| "9:05am - Manager A enters room, doesn't greet the 3 team members already present, sits at head of table, opens laptop. Team members exchange glances but say nothing." | "Power dynamic? Why no greeting? Team members seem uncomfortable - is this normal? I'm surprised by formality - expected more casual interaction based on company culture claims." |

---

### Level of Description

**Aim for "thick description":**

❌ **Thin:** "The meeting was tense."
✅ **Thick:** "Manager A spoke in clipped sentences, made no eye contact. Two team members sat with arms crossed. When questioned, responses were one word. Long silences between exchanges (10-15 seconds). One team member checked phone repeatedly."

**Thick description includes:**
- Specific behaviors (not interpretations)
- Direct quotes (verbatim when possible)
- Physical details (posture, positioning, environment)
- Sequence of events
- Duration and timing

---

### Note-Taking Method

**During observation:**
- [ ] **Jottings:** Quick keywords, fragments to trigger memory
- [ ] **Full field notes:** Complete sentences written during observation
- [ ] **Audio recording:** Verbal notes into recorder (requires consent)
- [ ] **Photography/video:** Visual documentation (requires consent)

**Selected method:** [Which will you use? Why?]

**Immediately after observation (within 2 hours):**
- [ ] **Expanded field notes:** Convert jottings into full detailed notes
- [ ] **Reflective memo:** Write about patterns, questions, interpretations

**CRITICAL:** Jottings MUST be expanded same day or details are lost.

---

## Sampling Strategy

### Site Selection

**Where will you observe:**
- **Site 1:** [Location/setting]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this site?]
  - **Access:** [How will you gain entry?]
  - **Duration:** [How long will you observe here?]

- **Site 2:** [Location/setting]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this site?]
  - **Access:** [How will you gain entry?]
  - **Duration:** [How long will you observe here?]

**Diversity goals:**
[What variation do you need? Different times? Locations? Situations?]

---

### Temporal Sampling

**When will you observe:**

**Time of day:**
- [ ] Morning
- [ ] Afternoon
- [ ] Evening
- [ ] Multiple times (to capture temporal variation)

**Day of week:**
- [ ] Weekday
- [ ] Weekend
- [ ] Multiple days

**Duration per session:**
[30 min / 2 hours / Full day / Extended immersion over days/weeks?]

**Rationale:** [Why these times?]

---

### What to Sample

**Sampling approach:**
- [ ] **Continuous:** Observe everything during defined time period
- [ ] **Event sampling:** Observe only when specific event occurs
- [ ] **Time sampling:** Observe at set intervals (e.g., every hour on the hour)

**Selected approach:** [Which and why?]

---

## Access & Ethics

### Gaining Access

**Gatekeepers to contact:**
- [Who controls access to observation site?]
- [How will you approach them?]

**Access request template:**

"Dear [Gatekeeper],

I'm conducting research on [topic] to understand [goal]. I would like to observe [setting/activities] to gain insight into [what you hope to learn].

The observation would involve:
- [Duration] on [dates]
- [My role - participant/non-participant]
- [Note-taking / recording methods]
- [What I'll do with the data]

[If participants will know: I will explain my research to participants and obtain their consent.]

[If participants won't know: I request permission to observe without disclosing research purpose because [ethical justification].]

Would you be willing to discuss this further?

Thank you,
[Your name]"

---

### Informed Consent

**Overt observation consent approach:**

**Before observation begins:**
1. **Explain research:** "I'm studying [topic] to understand [goal]"
2. **Explain process:** "I'll be observing [what] and taking notes on [what specifically]"
3. **Explain confidentiality:** "I won't use names. Notes will be [how stored/who has access]"
4. **Answer questions:** "Do you have any questions?"
5. **Obtain consent:** "Are you comfortable with me observing?"

**Consent log:**

| Date | Location | Person/Group | Consent Obtained | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| [Date] | [Site] | [Who] | ✓ Yes / No | [Special conditions?] |

---

**Covert observation ethical justification (if applicable):**

[If you plan covert observation, you MUST justify why disclosure would compromise research and why benefits outweigh risks. Most research requires overt observation.]

---

### Managing Observer Effect

**Observer effect:** People change behavior when they know they're observed.

**Strategies to minimize:**
1. **Prolonged engagement:** Spend time on-site before formal observation so people acclimate
2. **Blend in:** Dress appropriately for setting, adopt similar body language
3. **Be unobtrusive:** Position yourself peripherally, avoid eye contact that invites interaction
4. **Build rapport:** If participant observation, engage naturally without being intrusive

**Document in reflexivity notes:** When/how you think your presence affected behavior.

---

## Field Note Template

**Use this structure for each observation session:**

```markdown

## Observation Types Reference

### Participant Observation
**Definition:** Researcher actively participates while observing
**Pros:** Access to insider perspective, understand tacit knowledge
**Cons:** Harder to observe while doing, may "go native" and lose objectivity
**Example:** Working alongside employees to understand their process

### Non-Participant Observation
**Definition:** Researcher observes without participating
**Pros:** Can focus entirely on observing, maintains distance
**Cons:** May be seen as outsider, miss tacit knowledge
**Example:** Sitting in corner of workspace taking notes on interactions

### Structured Observation
**Definition:** Using predefined categories or checklist
**Pros:** Systematic, consistent, comparable across sessions
**Cons:** May miss unexpected insights, rigid
**Example:** Counting frequency of specific behaviors

### Unstructured Observation
**Definition:** Open-ended, exploratory observation
**Pros:** Flexible, captures unexpected patterns
**Cons:** Can be overwhelming, harder to compare across sessions
**Example:** General field notes on everything happening

**Most qualitative research uses:** Non-participant, unstructured (or semi-structured) observation with thick description.
