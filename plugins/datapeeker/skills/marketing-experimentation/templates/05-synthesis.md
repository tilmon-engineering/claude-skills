## Cross-Experiment Patterns

**Tactic Performance:**
[Do results cluster by tactic? Which tactics performed best/worst?]

**Audience Segments:**
[Do results vary by audience segment? Which segments responded best?]

**Timing/Seasonality:**
[Do results show temporal patterns? Were some experiments affected by timing?]

**Confounding Factors:**
[Were there external factors (market conditions, holidays, competitors) affecting multiple experiments?]

**Confidence Assessment:**
[Which findings are robust? Which are uncertain? Where is more data needed?]

## Overall Campaign Signal Classification

**Signal:** [Positive | Negative | Null | Mixed]

**Rationale:**

**Positive Campaign:**
[If positive: Multiple experiments validated concept, successful tactics identified, clear path to ROI]

**Negative Campaign:**
[If negative: Multiple experiments invalidated concept, no successful tactics, concept doesn't resonate]

**Null Campaign:**
[If null: Most experiments inconclusive, insufficient power or confounding factors, needs refinement]

**Mixed Campaign:**
[If mixed: Some tactics work, some don't, selective scaling and pivots needed]
