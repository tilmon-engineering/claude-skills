# Research Design - Focus Group Method

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 1 - Research Design
**Method:** Focus Groups

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
[What are you trying to understand through focus groups?]

**Sub-Questions:**
1. [Supporting question 1]
2. [Supporting question 2]
3. [Supporting question 3]

**Success Criteria:**
[What would constitute a successful answer to this research question?]

---

## Reflexivity Baseline (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Document your assumptions BEFORE data collection to prevent confirmation bias.

### My Assumptions

**What I believe the answer will be:**
[Write down what you expect to find. Be specific.]

**Why I believe this:**
[What experience, expert opinion, or prior knowledge shapes this belief?]

**What would surprise me:**
[What findings would contradict your expectations?]

### My Biases

**Industry/domain experience:**
[How might your background influence what you notice or interpret?]

**Expert opinions I'm carrying:**
[What have mentors, consultants, or authorities told you?]

**Prior hypotheses:**
[What have you already concluded that might bias interpretation?]

**Desired outcome:**
[What result would you WANT to find? How might this create bias?]

---

## Focus Group Strategy

**Why focus groups instead of interviews?**
[Group interaction reveals social norms, shared experiences, disagreements, consensus-building]

**Group size:** [6-10 participants per session recommended]

**Number of sessions:** [3-5 sessions recommended for saturation]

**Session duration:** [90-120 minutes typical]

**Format:** [In-person / Virtual via Zoom / Hybrid]

---

## Participant Selection

### Sampling Strategy

**Total participants needed:** [N participants across M sessions]

**Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous groups:**
- [ ] **Homogeneous:** Same background/experience (encourages candor)
- [ ] **Heterogeneous:** Diverse backgrounds (encourages varied perspectives)
- [ ] **Segmented:** Multiple homogeneous groups to compare (e.g., Group 1 = managers, Group 2 = individual contributors)

**Rationale:** [Why this composition?]

### Inclusion Criteria

**Who should participate:**
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]

### Exclusion Criteria

**Who should NOT participate:**
- [Criterion 1 - e.g., "Direct competitors"]
- [Criterion 2 - e.g., "People with power dynamics over each other"]
- [Criterion 3]

**CRITICAL:** Avoid power imbalances within groups (manager + their direct report, buyer + seller, etc.)

### Recruitment Plan

**Recruitment method:** [Email / Referrals / Social media / etc.]

**Recruitment message template:**

## Discussion Guide

**Purpose:** Structured agenda to guide discussion while allowing organic interaction.

### Session Structure

**Total time:** [90-120 minutes]

1. **Welcome & Setup** (10 min)
2. **Warm-up** (10 min)
3. **Core Discussion** (50-70 min)
4. **Wrap-up & Closing** (10-20 min)

---

### 1. Welcome & Setup (10 minutes)

**Welcome participants:**
"Thank you all for joining today's discussion on [topic]. I'm [name] and I'll be facilitating our conversation."

**Purpose & goals:**
"We're here to understand [research goal]. Your experiences and perspectives are valuable. There are no right or wrong answers - we want to hear diverse viewpoints."

**Consent & recording:**
"This session will be recorded [audio/video] so I can focus on facilitating rather than taking notes. The recording will be transcribed and [stored securely / deleted after transcription]. Your comments will be [anonymous / confidential] in any reports."

## Facilitator Techniques

### Managing Group Dynamics

#### The Dominant Talker

**Symptoms:** One person answers every question, talks over others

**Interventions:**
1. **Direct others:** "Thank you [Name]. I'd love to hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet. [Other name], what's your experience?"
2. **Use hand raising:** "Let's hear from a few different people. Raise your hand if you've experienced this."
3. **Private check-in:** [If virtual] Private message: "Thank you for your input. Can you help me draw out quieter voices?"

#### The Quiet Participant

**Symptoms:** Someone hasn't spoken much, seems disengaged

**Interventions:**
1. **Direct invitation:** "[Name], I notice you haven't shared yet - I'd love to hear your perspective on this."
2. **Easier entry point:** Ask them to respond to something specific vs open-ended question
3. **Non-verbal check:** [If in-person] Eye contact, open body language to invite them in
4. **Accept silence:** Some people process by listening - that's OK

#### The Tangent

**Symptoms:** Discussion veers off-topic

**Interventions:**
1. **Acknowledge & redirect:** "That's interesting. Let's bookmark that and come back to [topic]."
2. **Check relevance:** "How does this relate to [topic]?"
3. **Group decision:** "This is interesting - should we explore this or return to [topic]?"

#### The Disagreement

**Symptoms:** Participants disagree, tension rises

**This is GOOD - lean into it:**
1. **Normalize:** "It sounds like there are different experiences here - that's valuable."
2. **Explore:** "Tell me more about why you see it differently."
3. **Avoid resolving:** Don't try to create consensus - diversity is the goal
4. **Intervene only if:** Disrespectful or personal attacks

#### The Groupthink

**Symptoms:** Everyone agrees quickly, little depth

**Interventions:**
1. **Push deeper:** "What makes you say that? Can you give a specific example?"
2. **Invite dissent:** "Does anyone see this differently?"
3. **Play devil's advocate:** "Some people might say [contrarian view] - what do you think?"

---

### Probing Questions

**When someone gives surface-level answer:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What did that look like in practice?"

**When someone states opinion without context:**
- "Why do you think that?"
- "What experience led you to that conclusion?"

**When you want to explore difference:**
- "How is that different from [earlier point]?"
- "Does anyone have a contrasting experience?"

**When you want depth:**
- "Walk me through what happened step by step"
- "What was the outcome?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
