### 1. Welcome & Ground Rules (10 minutes)

**START RECORDING**

**Verbal consent on recording:**
"Before we begin, I'm starting the recording now. By staying in this session, you consent to being recorded. If anyone is not comfortable, please let me know now."

**Welcome script:**
"Thank you all for being here. I'm [name] and [role/affiliation]. We're here today to discuss [topic] and I want to learn from your experiences.

There are no right or wrong answers - I'm interested in your honest perspectives. You may hear different opinions from others in the room, and that's valuable.

This session will be recorded so I can focus on facilitating rather than taking notes. The recording will be transcribed and your names will be replaced with pseudonyms. Nothing you say will be directly attributed to you by name."

**Ground rules:**
1. "One person speaks at a time - please don't talk over each other"
2. "All perspectives are valued - there's no right answer"
3. "What's shared here stays here - please respect each other's confidentiality"
4. "It's okay to disagree, but please do so respectfully"
5. "Please silence phones"
6. [Virtual] "Keep your video on if possible, use chat for questions"

**Introductions:**
"Let's go around the room. Please share your first name, [relevant context like role or how long you've worked with topic]."

[Note-taker: Document who's present and seating arrangement]

---

### 2. Warm-Up (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Get everyone comfortable speaking.

**Warm-up question:**
[Use question from discussion guide]

**Facilitator notes:**
- Go around the room so everyone speaks
- Keep this light and quick (1-2 min per person max)
- Show interest in every response
- Note themes for later exploration

---

### 3. Core Discussion (50-70 minutes)

**Follow discussion guide topics.**

**Active facilitation techniques:**

**Encourage depth:**
- "Can you give me a specific example of that?"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What did that look like?"

**Encourage interaction:**
- "Does anyone else have experience with this?"
- "How does your experience compare to what [Name] just shared?"
- "I'm hearing different perspectives - tell me more about why you see it differently"

**Redirect if needed:**
- "That's interesting - let's bookmark that and come back to [topic]"
- "How does this relate to [topic we were discussing]?"

**Balance participation:**
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken in a while. [Name], what do you think?"
- "I want to make sure we hear from everyone. [Quiet person], I'd love your perspective."

**Manage dominance:**
- "Thank you [Dominant person]. Let's hear from others on this."
- [To group] "Let's get a few different perspectives before we move on."

**CRITICAL:** Stay neutral - don't show agreement or disagreement with any viewpoint.

---

### 4. Wrap-Up (10-20 minutes)

**Summary:**
"We're coming to the end of our time. Let me summarize what I've heard... [Summarize 3-4 key themes]. Did I capture that accurately? Anything important I missed?"

**Final question (ALWAYS ask):**
"Before we close - is there anything about [topic] that we haven't discussed that you think is important?"

[Often yields valuable unexpected insights]

**Thank you:**
"Thank you all for your time and for sharing your perspectives so openly. This conversation has been incredibly valuable."

**Next steps:**
[If applicable: "I'll be analyzing these conversations along with [N] other groups and [what happens with findings]"]

**Incentive distribution:**
[If applicable: "I'll send your [gift card / compensation] to the email you provided within [timeframe]"]

### Version 1.0
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Used for:** Sessions 1-2
- **Changes needed:** [List based on reflexivity notes]

### Version 1.1
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Used for:** Sessions 3-4
- **Changes from 1.0:**
  1. [Change 1 - e.g., "Revised warm-up to be more specific"]
  2. [Change 2 - e.g., "Added probe about X that emerged in Session 1"]
  3. [Change 3 - e.g., "Removed Topic 4 - not yielding insights"]
- **Rationale:** [Why these changes?]

---

## Saturation Monitoring

**Purpose:** Track when new sessions stop yielding new insights.

**After each session, assess:**

- Did this session introduce NEW themes not seen before? [YES / NO]
- Did this session provide NEW examples of existing themes? [YES / NO]
- Did this session contradict or complicate existing themes? [YES / NO]

**Saturation status:**

| Session | New Themes? | New Examples? | Contradictions? | Saturation Status |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | N/A (first) | N/A | N/A | Building baseline |
| 2 | YES | YES | NO | Not yet |
| 3 | YES | YES | YES | Not yet |
| 4 | NO | YES | NO | Approaching |
| 5 | NO | NO | NO | Achieved |

**Saturation achieved when:** 2-3 consecutive sessions answer NO to all three questions.

**Current status:** [Not yet / Approaching / Achieved]

**Sessions conducted:** [N]
**Sessions remaining:** [N more scheduled / None - saturation reached]

---

## Managing Challenges

### Low Attendance

**If multiple no-shows reduce group size below 4:**

**Options:**
1. **Proceed anyway:** Groups of 3-4 can work but dynamics differ (more like group interview)
2. **Reschedule:** If below 3, consider rescheduling
3. **Recruit replacements:** Have backup participants on standby

**Document decision:** [What you did and why]

---

### Technical Failures

**If recording fails mid-session:**

1. **Note the time:** When did recording stop?
2. **Reconstruct:** Facilitator + note-taker write detailed notes immediately after
3. **Mark in transcript:** [RECORDING FAILED XX:XX - RECONSTRUCTED FROM NOTES]

**Prevention:** Always have backup recording device.

---

### Disruptive Participant

**If someone is disrespectful, dominating, or violating ground rules:**

**During session:**
1. Gently redirect: "Let's hear from others on this"
2. Reinforce ground rules: "Remember, one person at a time"
3. If continues: Take a break, speak privately

**Severe case:**
- Thank them for their time
- Ask them to leave (privately if possible)
- Continue session with remaining participants
- Document in reflexivity notes

---

### Topic Goes Dark/Unexpectedly Sensitive

**If conversation becomes emotionally difficult:**

1. **Pause:** "Let's take a moment"
2. **Check-in:** "Is everyone comfortable continuing with this topic?"
3. **Offer exit:** "We can skip this question if people prefer"
4. **Provide resources:** If topic triggers trauma, have resources to share afterward

**Document:** Note in reflexivity notes what happened and how you handled it.

## Common Focus Group Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Letting one person dominate**
- DO: Actively redirect to others

❌ **Asking yes/no questions**
- DO: Ask open-ended questions that require explanation

❌ **Moving on from disagreement too quickly**
- DO: Explore why people see it differently

❌ **Revealing your opinion or hypothesis**
- DO: Stay neutral and curious

❌ **Accepting vague generalities**
- DO: Probe for specific examples

❌ **Trying to create consensus**
- DO: Welcome and explore divergent views

❌ **Going through questions mechanically**
- DO: Follow interesting threads even if not in guide

❌ **Talking too much**
- DO: Listen 80%, talk 20%

✅ **Good facilitation looks like:**
- Everyone participates (though not equally)
- Participants talk to each other, not just to facilitator
- Specific examples and stories shared
- Disagreements explored respectfully
- Organic conversation flow while covering key topics
- Facilitator mostly listening and probing
