# Research Design - Interview Method

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 1 - Research Design
**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
[What are you trying to understand through these interviews?]

**Sub-Questions:**
1. [Supporting question 1]
2. [Supporting question 2]
3. [Supporting question 3]

**Success Criteria:**
[What would constitute a successful answer to this research question?]

---

## Reflexivity Baseline (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Document your assumptions BEFORE data collection to prevent confirmation bias.

### My Assumptions

**What I believe the answer will be:**
[Write down what you expect to find. Be specific.]

**Why I believe this:**
[What experience, expert opinion, or prior knowledge shapes this belief?]

**What would surprise me:**
[What findings would contradict your expectations?]

### My Biases

**Industry/domain experience:**
[How might your background influence what you notice or interpret?]

**Expert opinions I'm carrying:**
[What have mentors, consultants, or authorities told you?]

**Prior hypotheses:**
[What have you already concluded that might bias interpretation?]

**Desired outcome:**
[What result would you WANT to find? How might this create bias?]

## Interview Guide

**Interview Type:** Semi-Structured (recommended for balance of consistency and exploration)

**Duration:** [30-60 minutes typical]

**Format:** [In-person / Video call / Phone]

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm researching [general topic] to understand [broad goal]. Your insights will help us [purpose]. There are no right or wrong answers - I'm interested in your honest experience."

**Consent & Recording:**
"This conversation will take about [X] minutes. I'd like to [record / take notes] so I can focus on our conversation. Everything you share will be [confidentiality statement]. Are you comfortable proceeding?"

**Warm-up:**
"To start, can you tell me a bit about [relevant context - their role, company, etc.]?"

### Core Questions (30-45 minutes)

**CRITICAL:** Use Mom Test principles - ask about PAST BEHAVIOR, not hypothetical futures.

#### Question Set 1: Current State

**Goal:** Understand how they currently handle the situation (not how they'd use your solution)

**Q1:** "Can you walk me through how you currently [solve this problem / handle this situation]?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "What does that process look like day-to-day?"
  - "How long have you been doing it this way?"
  - "What made you choose this approach?"

**Q2:** "What's working well with your current approach?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "Can you give me a specific example?"
  - "What would you lose if you had to change this?"

**Q3:** "What's frustrating or challenging about your current approach?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "Can you describe a recent time when this was a problem?"
  - "What did that cost you?" (time, money, opportunity)
  - "How often does this happen?"

#### Question Set 2: Past Behavior & Attempts

**Goal:** Learn what they've ALREADY tried (reveals actual willingness to change/pay)

**Q4:** "Have you tried any alternatives or other approaches to this?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "What did you try?"
  - "What happened?"
  - "Why did you stop using it?" OR "Why did you switch?"

**Q5:** "When you chose your current solution, what were you comparing it against?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "What made you choose this one?"
  - "What was the decision process like?"
  - "Who was involved in the decision?"

#### Question Set 3: Actual Constraints & Trade-offs

**Goal:** Uncover real budget, timeline, decision-making constraints

**Q6:** "What would make you consider changing your current approach?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "What would need to be different?"
  - "Has that situation ever happened before?"
  - "What did you do then?"

**Q7:** "When you evaluate solutions like this, what matters most to you?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "Can you rank those by importance?"
  - "Have you ever made a trade-off between [X] and [Y]?"
  - "What did you choose and why?"

**Q8 (Budget reality check):** "Roughly what budget do you work with for [this category of solution]?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "How is that budget determined?"
  - "Do you have flexibility if something is particularly valuable?"
  - "What's the approval process for spending in this area?"

#### Question Set 4: Context & Specifics

**Goal:** Understand their specific situation and needs

**Q9:** "Can you describe a recent situation where [the problem] really impacted you?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "Walk me through what happened step by step"
  - "What was the outcome?"
  - "What would have made that situation better?"

**Q10:** "How does [this problem/situation] fit into your broader workflow?"
- **Follow-up probes:**
  - "What happens before this?"
  - "What happens after?"
  - "Who else is involved?"

### Closing (5-10 minutes)

**Wrap-up question:**
"Is there anything about [topic] that I haven't asked about that you think is important?"

**Referrals:**
"Do you know anyone else who deals with [this problem] who might be willing to share their perspective?"

**Thank you:**
"Thank you so much for your time and insights. This has been really helpful."

## Question Design Checklist

**For EACH core question, verify:**

- [ ] Asks about PAST behavior, not hypothetical future ("How do you currently..." not "Would you...")
- [ ] Open-ended (can't be answered with yes/no)
- [ ] Neutral (doesn't lead toward desired answer)
- [ ] Specific (asks for concrete examples, not generalities)
- [ ] Probes ready (follow-ups to dig deeper)

**Red flags - AVOID:**
- ❌ "Would you use a service that..."
- ❌ "Do you think it's important to..."
- ❌ "How much would you pay for..."
- ❌ "What features would you want..."

**Green flags - USE:**
- ✅ "How do you currently..."
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time..."
- ✅ "What have you tried..."
- ✅ "Walk me through your process..."

## Sampling Strategy

**Target Sample Size:** [8-15 interviews recommended for saturation]

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- [Who should be included? What characteristics must they have?]

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- [Who should be excluded? What would disqualify someone?]

**Diversity Goals:**
- [What diversity do you need? Industry? Company size? Role? Geography?]

**Recruitment Approach:**

1. **Method 1:** [e.g., LinkedIn outreach, referrals, existing network]
   - Expected reach: [N people]
   - Expected response rate: [X%]
   - Expected interviews: [N]

2. **Method 2:** [Secondary approach]
   - Expected reach:
   - Expected response rate:
   - Expected interviews:

**Saturation Monitoring:**
- Plan to conduct [N] interviews initially
- After interview [N], assess if new insights emerging
- Continue until 2-3 consecutive interviews add no new themes

## Phase 1 Checkpoint Verification

**Before proceeding to Phase 2, verify:**

- [ ] Research question defined and specific
- [ ] Interview guide created with neutral, open-ended questions
- [ ] All questions ask about PAST BEHAVIOR (not hypothetical futures)
- [ ] Follow-up probes prepared for each core question
- [ ] Sampling strategy documented (who, how many, how to recruit)
- [ ] **Reflexivity baseline completed** (assumptions and biases documented)
- [ ] Logistics planned (recording, scheduling, consent)
- [ ] All content saved to `01-research-design.md`

**Checkpoint status:** [PASS / FAIL]

**If PASS:** Proceed to Phase 2 - Data Collection
**If FAIL:** Complete missing requirements (especially reflexivity baseline)
