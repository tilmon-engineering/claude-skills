# Data Familiarization Notes

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 3 - Data Familiarization

---

## Data Overview

**Total Data Collected:**
- [N] interviews/surveys/sessions
- [N] total participants
- [Date range] for data collection

**Files Reviewed:**
- `raw-data/transcript-001.md` through `transcript-[N].md`
- OR `raw-data/survey-responses-batch-[N].md`
- OR `raw-data/field-notes-[N].md`

---

## Initial Observations (NOT Codes Yet)

**Purpose:** Document patterns noticed during reading WITHOUT creating formal codes. Just observe.

### Observation 1: [Topic/Pattern Name]

**What I noticed:**
[Describe what you're seeing across multiple data sources]

**Where it appears:**
- Participant [N]: [Brief note]
- Participant [N]: [Brief note]
- Participant [N]: [Brief note]

**Frequency:** [How often does this come up?]

---

### Observation 2: [Topic/Pattern Name]

[Same structure...]

---

### Observation 3: [Topic/Pattern Name]

[Same structure...]

---

## Surprising Findings

**Purpose:** Note what contradicts your assumptions from Phase 1 reflexivity baseline.

### Surprise 1: [What was unexpected]

**What I expected:** [From Phase 1 assumptions]

**What I actually saw:** [Contradictory data]

**Evidence:**
- "[Quote]" - Participant [N]
- "[Quote]" - Participant [N]

**Impact:** [How does this change my understanding?]

### Surprise 2: [What was unexpected]

[Same structure...]

## Emerging Questions

**Purpose:** Document questions that emerge from data review. These guide Phase 4 coding.

1. **Question:** [What would you want to explore further?]
   - **Why this matters:** [How does this relate to research question?]
   - **Where to look:** [Which participants/data segments to examine?]

2. **Question:** [Next question]
   - **Why this matters:**
   - **Where to look:**

3. **Question:** [Next question]
   - **Why this matters:**
   - **Where to look:**

## Reflexivity Update

**Purpose:** Document how your understanding is evolving during familiarization.

**My initial assumptions (from Phase 1):**
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]
- [Assumption 3]

**How the data challenges/confirms these:**
- [Assumption 1]: [Confirmed / Challenged / Complicated by data]
- [Assumption 2]: [Confirmed / Challenged / Complicated by data]
- [Assumption 3]: [Confirmed / Challenged / Complicated by data]

**New insights emerging:**
[What are you learning that you didn't expect?]

## Agent Summaries (if analyze-transcript agent used)

**Purpose:** If dataset is large (10+ transcripts), paste agent summaries here.

### Transcript-001 Summary

[Paste analyze-transcript agent output]

---

### Transcript-002 Summary

[Paste analyze-transcript agent output]

---

[Continue for all transcripts...]

## Next Steps

**Ready for Phase 4:** [Yes / No]

**If not ready:**
- [ ] Need to review [specific data]
- [ ] Need to clarify [specific question]
- [ ] Need to document [specific observation]

**If ready:**
- [ ] All data reviewed thoroughly
- [ ] Observations documented
- [ ] Surprises noted
- [ ] Questions identified
- [ ] Reflexivity updated

**Proceed to:** Phase 4 - Systematic Coding
