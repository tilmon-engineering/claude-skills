# Research Design - Survey Method

**Session:** [session-name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** 1 - Research Design
**Method:** Qualitative Survey

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
[What are you trying to understand through this survey?]

**Sub-Questions:**
1. [Supporting question 1]
2. [Supporting question 2]
3. [Supporting question 3]

**Success Criteria:**
[What would constitute a successful answer to this research question?]

---

## Reflexivity Baseline (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Document your assumptions BEFORE data collection to prevent confirmation bias.

### My Assumptions

**What I believe the answer will be:**
[Write down what you expect to find. Be specific.]

**Why I believe this:**
[What experience, expert opinion, or prior knowledge shapes this belief?]

**What would surprise me:**
[What findings would contradict your expectations?]

### My Biases

**Industry/domain experience:**
[How might your background influence what you notice or interpret?]

**Expert opinions I'm carrying:**
[What have mentors, consultants, or authorities told you?]

**Prior hypotheses:**
[What have you already concluded that might bias interpretation?]

**Desired outcome:**
[What result would you WANT to find? How might this create bias?]

---

## Survey Strategy

**Survey Type:** Open-ended qualitative survey (NOT quantitative Likert scales)

**Purpose:**
[Why a survey instead of interviews? Broader reach? Async? Geographic diversity?]

**Target completion time:** [10-20 minutes recommended for response rates]

**Question count:** [8-15 open-ended questions recommended]

---

## Question Design

**CRITICAL:** Open-ended questions that yield rich, detailed text responses.

### Question Set 1: Context & Background

**Q1: Screening/Demographics**
[What contextual information do you need about respondents?]

Example format:
"What is your role/industry/context relevant to this research?"
- Keep brief (2-3 questions max)
- Only ask what's necessary for analysis
- Place at beginning OR end (test which gets better response)

---

### Question Set 2: Core Open-Ended Questions

**Q2:** [First main research question]

**Question text:**
"[Open-ended question asking about experience, behavior, or process]"

**What this question aims to uncover:**
[What insight are you seeking?]

**Probes/examples to include:**
[Optional: Add prompt like "Please describe in detail..." or "For example..."]

---

**Q3:** [Second main question]

[Same structure as Q2...]

---

**Q4:** [Third main question]

[Same structure as Q2...]

---

### Question Set 3: Depth & Examples

**Q5: Specific Example Prompt**

**Question text:**
"Can you describe a specific, recent situation where [topic]?"

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What happened?"
- "What was the outcome?"
- "How did that make you feel / what did you do?"

**Why specific examples matter:**
[Specificity prevents vague generalities - you want stories, not opinions]

---

**Q6:** [Another depth question]

[Same structure...]

---

### Question Set 4: Challenges & Context

**Q7: Challenge/Frustration Question**

**Question text:**
"What challenges or frustrations have you experienced with [topic]?"

**Probe:**
"Please provide specific examples if possible."

---

**Q8:** [Additional context question]

[Same structure...]

---

### Question Set 5: Closing & Follow-Up

**Q9: Anything Missed**

**Question text:**
"Is there anything about [topic] that we haven't asked about that you think is important?"

**Purpose:** Let respondents share what THEY think matters

---

**Q10: Follow-Up Consent (Optional)**

**Question text:**
"Would you be willing to participate in a brief follow-up interview to explore your responses in more depth?"

- [ ] Yes, contact me at: [email field]
- [ ] No, thank you

**Purpose:** Identify rich cases for deeper investigation

---

## Question Design Checklist

**For EACH question, verify:**

- [ ] Open-ended (can't be answered with yes/no or single word)
- [ ] Asks about EXPERIENCE or BEHAVIOR (not hypothetical futures)
- [ ] Neutral (doesn't lead toward desired answer)
- [ ] Clear and specific (respondent knows exactly what you're asking)
- [ ] One question per item (no double-barreled questions)
- [ ] Appropriate reading level (grade 8-10 recommended)

**Red flags - AVOID:**

❌ "Do you think [X] is important?" (yes/no + leading)
❌ "Would you use [Y]?" (hypothetical + yes/no)
❌ "Rate your satisfaction with [Z]" (quantitative scale, not qualitative)
❌ "What features would you want?" (hypothetical, not experience-based)
❌ "How often do you [X] and what challenges do you face?" (double-barreled)

**Green flags - USE:**

✅ "Describe your experience with [X]"
✅ "Tell us about a recent time when [Y]"
✅ "What challenges have you encountered with [Z]?"
✅ "Walk us through how you currently [process]"
✅ "What matters most to you about [topic]?"

## Survey Structure & Flow

**Recommended order:**

1. **Welcome screen**
   - Purpose of survey
   - Estimated time
   - Anonymity/confidentiality statement
   - Consent

2. **Context questions** (2-3 questions)
   - Who they are / screening
   - Keep brief

3. **Core open-ended questions** (5-8 questions)
   - Main research questions
   - Start broad, then narrow
   - Progress from easy to more complex

4. **Depth/example questions** (2-3 questions)
   - Specific examples
   - Stories and details

5. **Closing questions** (1-2 questions)
   - Anything missed
   - Follow-up consent

6. **Thank you screen**
   - Appreciation
   - What happens next (if applicable)
   - Incentive details (if applicable)

**Flow principles:**

---

## Pilot Testing (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Test survey before full distribution to catch confusing questions.

### Pilot Test Plan

**Pilot sample size:** [5-10 people recommended]

**Pilot recruitment:**
- [Who will you recruit? Friends/colleagues who fit target audience?]
- Criteria: Should match target audience but NOT be in final sample

**Pilot test date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Pilot Test Feedback Questions

**After pilot respondents complete survey, ask:**

1. "How long did this survey take you?"
2. "Were any questions confusing or unclear?"
3. "Were any questions leading or biased?"
4. "Did you feel like you could answer honestly?"
5. "What questions were difficult to answer and why?"

**Questions flagged as confusing:**
- Q[N]: "[Question text]"
  - **Issue:** [What was confusing?]
  - **Revision:** [How will you revise it?]

**Questions flagged as leading:**
- Q[N]: "[Question text]"
  - **Issue:** [How was it leading?]
  - **Revision:** [How will you make it neutral?]

**Questions that yielded thin responses:**
- Q[N]: "[Question text]"
  - **Issue:** [Why were responses thin?]
  - **Revision:** [How will you encourage detail?]

**New topics identified:**

2. [Change 2 - e.g., "Added prompt for examples to Q5"]
3. [Change 3 - e.g., "Split double-barreled Q7 into two questions"]

**Rationale:** [Why these changes based on pilot feedback]

---

## Sampling Strategy

**Target Sample Size:** [50-100+ for qualitative survey with open-ended questions]

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- [Who should be excluded? What would disqualify someone?]

**Diversity Goals:**
- [What diversity do you need? Industry? Company size? Role? Geography?]
- [How will you ensure diverse sample?]

---

## Recruitment Plan

**Method 1:** [e.g., Email list, LinkedIn, social media, etc.]
- **Expected reach:** [N people]
- **Expected response rate:** [X% - typically 10-30% for cold outreach]
- **Expected responses:** [N]

**Method 2:** [Secondary approach]
- **Expected reach:** [N people]
- **Expected response rate:** [X%]
- **Expected responses:** [N]

**Method 3 (if needed):** [Backup approach]

**Total expected responses:** [N]

**Recruitment timeline:**
- **Survey launch:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Incentive Strategy (if applicable)

**Delivery method:** [How will incentive be provided?]

**Budget:** [$X total, $Y per response]

**Incentive announcement:**
[Where/how will you announce incentive? On welcome screen? In recruitment message?]

**Note:** For qualitative research, incentive typically helps response rate but can bias sample toward incentive-motivated respondents. Consider:
- Higher incentive = better response rate but potentially less genuine responses
- Lower/no incentive = lower response rate but more genuinely interested respondents

---

## Consent & Ethics

**Consent method:** [Checkbox on welcome screen / Separate consent form]

**Consent statement:**
