# Claude Code Skills Directory

This directory contains project-specific skills for Claude Code. Skills are reusable workflows and processes that guide Claude's behavior for specific tasks.

## Directory Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
.claude/skills/
├── skill-name/
│   ├── SKILL.md          (required - the skill definition)
│   ├── reference.md      (optional - additional documentation)
│   ├── examples.md       (optional - usage examples)
│   ├── scripts/          (optional - helper utilities)
│   │   └── helper.py
│   └── templates/        (optional - file templates)
│       └── template.txt
└── CLAUDE.md             (this file - directory documentation)
```

## Current Skills

This project contains the following skills:

### Process Skills
- **comparative-analysis** - Systematic comparison of segments, cohorts, or time periods
- **exploratory-analysis** - Discover patterns in unfamiliar data and identify meaningful insights
- **guided-investigation** - Investigate open-ended questions through systematic decomposition
- **hypothesis-testing** - Rigorous hypothesis testing process for data analysis

### Component Skills
- **creating-visualizations** - Create effective text-based visualizations in analysis sessions
- **interpreting-results** - Systematic result interpretation with intellectual honesty
- **understanding-data** - Systematic data profiling and exploration
- **writing-queries** - Systematic SQL query development

## SKILL.md File Format

Each skill must have a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-identifier
description: What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
allowed-tools: [optional - restrict to specific tools]
---

# Skill Name

## Instructions
[Step-by-step guidance for Claude to follow]
```

### Required Fields

- **name**: Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters)
- **description**: Brief description that helps Claude decide when to use this skill

### Optional Fields

- **allowed-tools**: Array of tool names to restrict Claude to (e.g., `[Read, Grep, Glob]`)

## How Skills Work

**Model-invoked discovery**: Claude automatically discovers and uses skills based on the task and the skill's description. You don't need to explicitly invoke them like slash commands.

**Progressive disclosure**: Claude reads skill files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently.

## Creating or Editing Skills

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: When creating new skills or editing existing ones, you MUST use the `ed3d-extending-claude:writing-skills` skill.

This skill ensures:
- Skills are tested with subagents before deployment
- Skills work under pressure and resist rationalization
- Skills follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for process documentation

Do not write or edit skills without using this skill.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep skills focused**: Each skill should address a single, specific capability
2. **Write clear descriptions**: Include trigger terms that users are likely to mention
3. **Use specific language**: Vague descriptions mean Claude won't know when to use the skill
4. **Test with the team**: Verify that skills activate correctly and provide clear guidance
5. **Use Unix paths**: Always use forward slashes in file paths
6. **Document changes**: Track version history so the team understands evolution
7. **Make scripts executable**: Run `chmod +x scripts/*.py` for helper scripts

## Debugging Skills

If Claude doesn't use a skill when expected:

1. Check description specificity - is it clear when to use this skill?
2. Verify file paths are correct (`.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`)
3. Validate YAML frontmatter syntax
4. Run `claude --debug` to see error details
5. Ask Claude to read the skill directly with the Read tool
