## Generated Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: [Brief statement]

**Tactic/Channel:** [landing page | ad campaign | email sequence | content marketing | social media | SEO | etc.]

**Expected Outcome:** [Specific, measurable result - e.g., "15%+ increase in conversion rate"]

**Rationale:** [Why we believe this will work based on discovery findings]

**Variables to Test:** [What will we manipulate/measure]

**AARRR Mapping:** [Acquisition | Activation | Retention | Referral | Revenue]

## Framework Mappings

### Lean Startup Build-Measure-Learn

For each hypothesis, identify:

| Hypothesis | Build (MVP) | Measure (Metrics) | Learn (Insights) |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| H1 | [What's the minimum viable test?] | [What metrics indicate success/failure?] | [What will we learn regardless of outcome?] |
| H2 | [What's the minimum viable test?] | [What metrics indicate success/failure?] | [What will we learn regardless of outcome?] |
| H3 | [What's the minimum viable test?] | [What metrics indicate success/failure?] | [What will we learn regardless of outcome?] |
| H4 | [What's the minimum viable test?] | [What metrics indicate success/failure?] | [What will we learn regardless of outcome?] |
| H5 | [What's the minimum viable test?] | [What metrics indicate success/failure?] | [What will we learn regardless of outcome?] |

### AARRR Pirate Metrics Coverage

Verify hypotheses cover multiple stages:

| AARRR Stage | Hypotheses Addressing This Stage | Coverage |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| **Acquisition** (How do users find us?) | [List hypothesis IDs] | [Good/Adequate/Insufficient] |
| **Activation** (Great first experience?) | [List hypothesis IDs] | [Good/Adequate/Insufficient] |
| **Retention** (Do they come back?) | [List hypothesis IDs] | [Good/Adequate/Insufficient] |
| **Referral** (Do they tell others?) | [List hypothesis IDs] | [Good/Adequate/Insufficient] |
| **Revenue** (Do they pay?) | [List hypothesis IDs] | [Good/Adequate/Insufficient] |

## Tactic Coverage

Verify hypotheses cover diverse marketing tactics:

### Acquisition Tactics

| Tactic | Hypotheses | Count |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Landing pages | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |
| Ad campaigns | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |
| Content marketing | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |
| SEO | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |

### Activation Tactics

| Tactic | Hypotheses | Count |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Email sequences | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |
| Product tours | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |
| Social proof | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |

### Retention Tactics

| Tactic | Hypotheses | Count |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Email campaigns | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |
| Content/newsletters | [List hypothesis IDs] | [number] |

**Tactic Diversity Assessment:** [Good - covers multiple tactics | Needs improvement - too focused on one tactic]

## User Confirmation

- [ ] All hypotheses reviewed and confirmed
- [ ] Hypotheses are testable and meaningful
- [ ] Tactic coverage is appropriate (not all focused on one channel)
- [ ] Framework mappings are complete
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Prioritization
