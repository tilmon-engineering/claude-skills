# Iteration Planning

**Campaign:** [Campaign name]

**Based on Synthesis:** [Reference to 05-synthesis.md]

**Planning Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Campaign Summary

**Overall Signal:** [Positive | Negative | Null | Mixed]

**Key Wins:**
- [Successful tactic 1 with result]
- [Successful tactic 2 with result]

**Key Learnings:**
- [Learning 1 regardless of signal]
- [Learning 2 regardless of signal]
- [Learning 3 regardless of signal]

**Strategic Recommendation:** [What to do next based on signal]

## New Experiment Ideas

**IMPORTANT:** These are IDEAS, not hypotheses. Each idea must go through a new marketing-experimentation session (Phase 1: Discovery, Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation) before testing.

---

### Idea 1: [Brief descriptive name]

**Category:** Scale Winners

**Rationale:** [Why this idea based on synthesis findings]

**Expected Learning:** [What we'll learn from testing this idea]

**Based on:** [Which successful experiment(s) this builds on]

**Example:**
Scale value prop landing page to paid ads - E1 showed +18% conversion from simplified value prop. Apply winning message to ad creative to test if it improves ad CTR and cost-per-conversion.

---

### Idea 2: [Brief descriptive name]

**Category:** Investigate Nulls

**Rationale:** [Why this idea]

**Expected Learning:** [What we'll learn]

**Based on:** [Which null/mixed result this investigates]

**Example:**
Investigate email sequence timing sensitivity - E3 showed negative result but timing may be confound (sent during holidays). Retest to determine if sequence is inherently weak or if timing was the issue.

---

### Idea 3: [Brief descriptive name]

**Category:** Pivot from Failures

**Rationale:** [Why this idea]

**Expected Learning:** [What we'll learn]

**Based on:** [Which failed experiment this pivots from]

**Example:**
Pivot from broad ad targeting to lookalike audiences - E2 showed null result for broad targeting. Pivot to lookalike audiences based on E1 converters to test if targeting precision improves results.

---

### Idea 4: [Brief descriptive name]

**Category:** [Scale Winners | Investigate Nulls | Pivot from Failures | Explore New]

**Rationale:** [Why this idea]

**Expected Learning:** [What we'll learn]

**Based on:** [Relevant experiment or new direction]

---

### Idea 5: [Brief descriptive name]

[Same structure as above]

---

[Add Ideas 6-7 if applicable]

---

## Idea Categorization Summary

**Scale Winners:** [count] ideas
- [List idea numbers/names that scale successful tactics]

**Investigate Nulls:** [count] ideas
- [List idea numbers/names that investigate inconclusive results]

**Pivot from Failures:** [count] ideas
- [List idea numbers/names that pivot from negative results]

**Explore New:** [count] ideas
- [List idea numbers/names that test entirely new directions]

## Strategic Recommendations by Signal

[Select the appropriate section based on Overall Campaign Signal]

### For Positive Signal Campaigns:

**Recommendation: Proceed to Scaling**

**Actions:**
- Increase budget/effort on winning tactics ([list specific tactics])
- Apply winning patterns to new channels ([suggest channels])
- Optimize successful approaches for incremental gains

**Priority Ideas to Pursue:**
- [Idea # - Scale Winners category]
- [Idea # - Scale Winners category]

---

### For Negative Signal Campaigns:

**Recommendation: Major Pivot or Pause**

**Actions:**
- Pivot: Major change in approach, audience, or value proposition
- Pause: Reassess concept before additional investment
- Consider: Alternative concepts if no viable path forward

**Priority Ideas to Pursue:**
- [Idea # - Pivot from Failures category]
- [Idea # - Explore New category]

---

### For Null Signal Campaigns:

**Recommendation: Refine and Reinvestigate**

**Actions:**
- Redesign experiments with better power/clarity
- Address confounding factors identified in synthesis
- Extend observation periods if time-dependent

**Priority Ideas to Pursue:**
- [Idea # - Investigate Nulls category]
- [Idea # - improved versions of previous experiments]

---

### For Mixed Signal Campaigns:

**Recommendation: Selective Scaling + Strategic Pivots**

**Actions:**
- Double down on winners ([list successful tactics])
- Abandon or redesign losers ([list failed tactics])
- Focus next tests on promising areas

**Priority Ideas to Pursue:**
- [Idea # - Scale Winners for successful tactics]
- [Idea # - Pivot from Failures for unsuccessful tactics]

---

## Feed-Forward Pattern

**CRITICAL:** Ideas from this phase are NOT ready for testing. They MUST go through a new marketing-experimentation session.

### How Ideas Become Experiments:

```
Phase 6 generates IDEAS (this document)
         ↓
Start NEW marketing-experimentation session with selected idea
         ↓
Phase 1: Discovery & Asset Inventory
    - Invoke market-researcher agent to validate idea
    - Inventory assets for implementing idea
    - Define success criteria
         ↓
Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation
    - Formalize idea into 5-10 specific, testable hypotheses
    - Map hypotheses to tactics and expected outcomes
         ↓
Phases 3-6: Complete full experimental cycle
    - Prioritize hypotheses (Phase 3)
    - Coordinate experiments (Phase 4)
    - Synthesize results (Phase 5)
    - Generate next iteration ideas (Phase 6)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Ideas need market validation before testing (Phase 1)
- Ideas need formalization into specific hypotheses (Phase 2)
- Skipping discovery leads to untested assumptions
- Skipping hypothesis generation leads to vague experiments

**Example Flow:**

1. Phase 6 generates: "Scale value prop to ads" (idea)
2. Start new marketing-experimentation session
3. Phase 1: Research ad platform best practices, inventory ad assets
4. Phase 2: Generate hypotheses:
   - H1: Simplified value prop in ad headline increases CTR by 10%+
   - H2: Value prop in ad body copy increases conversion rate by 15%+
   - H3: Value prop as video script improves engagement by 20%+
5. Continue with Phases 3-6 to test formal hypotheses

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- Review iteration ideas with stakeholders
- Select 1-2 highest-priority ideas to pursue
- Decide: Start new marketing-experimentation session OR conclude campaign

**If Starting New Session:**
- Choose idea from this list
- Begin with Phase 1: Discovery & Asset Inventory
- Use market-researcher agent to validate selected idea
- Do NOT skip to Phase 2 - always start with Phase 1

**If Concluding Campaign:**
- Archive all analysis files
- Document key learnings in campaign retrospective
- Share synthesis findings with relevant teams
- Update knowledge base with validated tactics
