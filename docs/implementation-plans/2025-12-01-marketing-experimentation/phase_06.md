# Marketing Experimentation System Implementation Plan - Phase 6

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development to implement this plan task-by-task.

## Phase 6: Create Phase Templates (01-03)

[Due to length, see full plan in phase_03.md Task 1-3 for template 01-discovery.md, 02-hypothesis-generation.md, and 03-prioritization.md specifications. Key sections documented: business concept, market research findings, asset inventory, success criteria, constraints, hypothesis format with examples, framework mappings (Lean Startup, AARRR), tactic coverage table, ICE/RICE scoring, prioritized backlog, experiment sequence plan, dependencies.]

**Phase 6 Checkpoint Requirements:**
- ✓ Each template exists in templates/ directory (01, 02, 03)
- ✓ Templates include clear structure with placeholders
- ✓ Templates match instructions in corresponding phase sections
- ✓ Templates include examples where helpful
